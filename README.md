## Introduction
In most buildings, at the end of the month, a paper slip containing your monthly rent is slipped through your door or delivered to you through your caretaker. This may lead to an instant of the tenant claiming to not have received the slip as reason for their delayed payment of rent. The process of delivering these slips and ensuring it reaches the correct tenant may be tedious. For our project, we propose the development of a smart monthly bill generator that provides the user(tenant) with their final rent bill which includes water bill, garbage collection cost, security cost or any other charges, and the landlord is able to update the system monthly.

## Objectives
 - To provide a site where tenants can check their monthly rent and bills not yet paid.
 - Provide access to the site anytime and anywhere.
 - To allow for transparency between the tenant and the landlord
 - Allow for the landlord to track the water usage among tenants and how rent is paid monthly.

## Target customers
Landlords

## Value Proposition
This system will provide a tool that automates the billing process which will eventually lessen the landlords’ workload, while still providing a platform for tenants to receive their bills regardless of their physical location. The ability of the system to reduce physical contact between the landlord and tenants increases its value especially in this day in time.

## Application features and Description
It will require the user to sign in for access. The tenant will sign in and be able to see their monthly charges while the landlord has permission to make changes such as updating the water bill as per units consumed or any other cost whenever there is either an increase or decrease in price. The following features will be included:
- House No
- Units of water consumed
- Garbage cost
- Security cost
- Final rent  
++  
- Paid amount
- Amount due  
  Upon renting a house, the tenant will be given a username which is the House No and a password in order to have access to the application. The tenant signs in and is able to see their status (If the rent is fully paid or if they have a balance), plus other charges which include the water bill, garbage collection and security costs. All these features will be adjustable only to the landlord who will have a different log in as opposed to the tenants. Once a tenant terminates the rental contract, the password will be changed and a new one given to the new tenant. If any of the previous monthly charges have not been paid it will be added to the new month’s rental bill.

## Tools and Resources
- Python
- Pycharm IDE

## Challenge
The major challenge that we might face while developing the system is coming up with a user-friendly system that will best suit landlords who might not be very welcoming to technology. The system should be presented as a solution to an existing problem and not pose as a burden to its users.
